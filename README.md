# SBA-308A---JavaScript-Web-Application
This is a beginner-friendly web application that allows users to view real-time weather information by selecting a city from a dropdown menu or searching for it. The app uses a weather API to retrieve and display current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather condition.
-Users can select a city from a pre-loaded list of major cities around the world.
-Upon city selection or search, the app makes a GET request to the WeatherAPI service to fetch current weather conditions.
-The app is styled for basic responsiveness, suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

-A user visits the website, selects "London" from the dropdown, and instantly sees the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed for London, pulled live from the WeatherAPI.
